You are a Principal Enterprise Architect and Healthcare Domain Analyst.

This task EXTENDS the EXISTING
ENTERPRISE HEALTHCARE PLATFORM
(frontend + backend + AKS + security + AI agent).

Your responsibility is to perform a
FUNCTIONAL BENCHMARK & GAP ANALYSIS
based on publicly available capabilities of large healthcare platforms:

- Mayo Clinic
- Barts Health
- CRGH
- Hertility Health
- Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)
- WebMD
- Unmind
- Abortion Finder
- Thanks Ben
- Breastcancer.org

IMPORTANT: 
- Use ONLY GENERIC, PUBLICLY KNOWN healthcare features
- The goal is FUNCTIONAL COMPLETENESS, not cloning

==================================================
OBJECTIVE
==================================================

1. Identify COMMON healthcare portal capabilities
2. Compare them with the CURRENT platform
3. Identify MISSING or WEAK areas
4. ADD those capabilities in a SAFE, GENERIC way
5. Document WHY each feature matters
6. Map each feature to:
   - Microservice
   - Database
   - API
   - Security
   - Observability

==================================================
ROOT REPOSITORY (ALREADY EXISTS)
==================================================

enterprise-healthcare-platform-azure-secure

==================================================
NEW DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
==================================================

docs/12_functional_gap_analysis/

==================================================
MANDATORY OUTPUT STRUCTURE
==================================================

Every file MUST include:

1. Feature description
2. Why it exists in real healthcare systems
3. Which platforms inspired it (generic reference)
4. Whether it already exists in our system
5. If missing:
   - How to add it
   - Which microservice owns it
   - API changes
   - DB changes
6. Security & compliance considerations
7. Observability requirements
8. Interview talking points

==================================================
FILES TO GENERATE (IN ORDER)
==================================================

==================================================
01_Healthcare_Common_Functional_Capabilities.md
==================================================

Cover GENERIC features such as:
- Patient education & awareness
- Mental health support workflows
- Appointment & referral discovery
- Provider search & information
- Eligibility & guidance tools
- Support & helplines
- Self-service vs assisted flows

==================================================
02_Functional_Benchmark_Matrix.md
==================================================

Create a SAFE comparison table like:

Feature | Common in Industry | Present in Our Platform | Gap | Action
------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | --- | ------
Appointment booking | Yes | Yes | No | —
Mental health guidance | Yes | Partial | Yes | Add GuidanceService

==================================================
03_Missing_Features_and_Enhancements.md
==================================================

For EACH identified gap:
- Describe the feature
- Why it is needed
- Which healthcare platforms inspired it (generic)
- How to implement it safely

Examples:
- Mental health content & triage
- Educational content delivery
- Anonymous guidance flows
- Accessibility support

==================================================
04_New_Microservices_Introduced.md
==================================================

If gaps require new services, define them:

Examples:
- GuidanceService
- EducationContentService
- AccessibilityService
- SupportRoutingService

For each:
- Responsibilities
- APIs
- Data ownership
- Security boundaries

==================================================
05_AI_AGENT_ENHANCEMENTS_FROM_GAP_ANALYSIS.md
==================================================

Explain how AI Agent is extended to:
- Answer health education queries
- Route mental health requests
- Assist in discovery & guidance
- Escalate to human support safely

==================================================
06_SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE_IMPACT.md
==================================================

Explain:
- Why these features are sensitive
- How PHI is avoided or minimized
- Access controls
- Audit logging

==================================================
07_OBSERVABILITY_AND_QUALITY_CONTROLS.md
==================================================

For each new feature:
- What metrics to monitor
- What logs are required
- What alerts to configure
- How to detect misuse or failure

==================================================
08_INTERVIEW_POSITIONING.md
==================================================

Explain:
- How to talk about this gap analysis in interviews
- How it shows enterprise thinking
- How to explain “we studied industry leaders safely”

==================================================
FINAL EXPECTATION
==================================================

After this extension, the platform must:

- Cover MAJOR healthcare portal capabilities
- Remain SAFE and NON-PROPRIETARY
- Show architect-level benchmarking skills
- Be easy to explain to recruiters & architects

DO NOT:
- Copy exact workflows from named organizations
- Use real clinical decision logic
- Introduce compliance violations
